## Overview

_**Custom Portfolio** Is an open source free to use portfolio starter. The idea is that someone can clone down the git repo and deploy the site to heroku and netlify, or whatever package their chip they choose, and then adjust the username and password for custom login. At that point they will be able to add examples of their project work, skills they wish to showcase, and receive messages from anyone browsing the site who wishes to contact them. They will be able to add edit and delete new projects and skills along with being able to delete read messages._
